# **[CNS 2018 workshop](http://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2018)**
Large neural networks, biological or artificial, can learn complex input-output relations. During learning, the network dynamics are often constrained to a low-dimensional manifold despite available high-dimensional space. The mechanism behind this space dimensionality confinement is yet unclear. 

Current technological advances in chronic population recordings and optogenetics provide the tools to measure and manipulate the reorganization of this state-space structure in neural circuits in awake, behaving animals during learning. 

We will bring together theoreticians and experimentalists to address a most fundamental question in neuroscience, that is, how learning reshapes collective network activity. 

More specifically, we will explore the following questions: 
* How does the neural dimensionality of a learned task relate to the task complexity? 
* Which mathematical tools are suitable to identify low-dimensional neural manifolds and track their emergence during learning?
* How does the dimensionality constrain the learning capabilities?
